## Features

- Design

The design was planned to offer a clean, minimalist layout, with a white background and black navigation bar, highlighting the colors of the coffee images, the different shades of brown, harmoniously interacting with black and white.

- Navigation

Navigation is quite simple, basically we have a menu on the left with the main features, containing three buttons (Home, All Posts, Create Post)

Home - It always takes you to the home page, where the posts are displayed.
All Posts - Displays a list of posts, where it is possible to update or delete each post.
Create Post - Through this button, the user has access to the post form, with basically the author, text and upload image fields.

On the right we have a hamburger menu, where user login and registration features are presented.

## The Header

The header consists of the logo on the left and the navigation links on the right, whitesmoke white colors were used for the logo and navigation links, however when active, the link incorporates the color yellow (#e3c15c).

When hovering the mouse over the navigation links, a border appears in the background, highlighting the element and helping the user navigate.

## The About Section

The about section tells a little about the history, the meaning of Yoga, its benefits to health, body and mind.
It also informs the user, the advantages and benefits after becoming a member of the club.

As background, a transparency was used, but allowing good legibility of the font, at the same time allowing the visualization of the background image.

## The Gallery Section

The Gallery section presents two basic poses of Yoga, through two images, between the images a mini class was introduced, "Yoga poses for Beginners", presenting the main movements of Yoga. The video was embedded from Youtube, saving your storage space.

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Life Yoga Club, changing color on hover.

The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media
