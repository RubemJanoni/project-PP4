## Features

- Design

The design was planned to offer a clean, minimalist layout, with a white background and black navigation bar, highlighting the colors of the coffee images, the different shades of brown, harmoniously interacting with black and white.

- Navigation

Navigation is quite simple, basically we have a menu on the left with the main features, containing three buttons (Home, All Posts, Create Post)

**Home** - It always takes you to the home page, where the posts are displayed.

**All Posts** - Displays a list of posts, where it is possible to update or delete each post.

**Create Post** - Through this button, the user has access to the post form, with basically the author, text and upload image fields.

The **All post** and **Create Post** buttons take the user to the list of posts and the creation form respectively, as shown in the images below.

  On the right we have a hamburger menu, where user login and registration features are presented.
  The user will only be able to create, change and delete a post after registering and logging in.
